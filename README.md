# CSV to ACV converter

Mostly just a little tool made to convert dot gain compensation curves from https://cielab.xyz/dlp/ to ACV files that Photoshop (and printer RIP software) can read.
Currently, you'll need to edit the filename to import and export in main.py itself. 

Eventually I'll just make a command line version that supports this, but for now this suffices.
